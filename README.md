# Module 01 - Introduction
1. Introduction
2. Big O Time Complexity
    * Growth is with respect to the input
    * Constants are dropped
    * Worst case is usually the way we measure
    * Upper Bound
3. Arrays Data Structure
    * They are fixes size, continiguos memory chunks
    * That means you cannot grow it
    * There is no "insertAt" or push or pop.Doesn't mean you can't write those though
4. Array Q&A

# Module 02 - Search
5.  Linear Search & Kata Setup 
    *  a [x0=v? , , , ,  ] search (arr, v)
    * What's the Big O? O(N)
    
    * Important Concepts:
        - Grown is with respect to the input
        - Constants are dropped
        - Worst case is usually way we measure
    
    * Setup Kata:
        - Github repo: [https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/kata-machine](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/kata-machine)
        - gh repo clone ThePrimeagen/kata-machine
        - cd kata-machine
        - yarn install
        - yarn generate
        - Test: npx jest NAME_OF_ALGORITHM

6. Binary Search Algorithms
    * What's the Big O?(LogN)
    *  If the input halves at each step, its likely O(LogN) or O(NlogN)

# Notes

### Algorithms (The A In DSA)
    
    - When applicable. Pretend that JS actually has arrays.
    - Only have access to the .length property of an array. So won't go full C neckbeard and require length to be passed in
